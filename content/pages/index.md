    title: About
    content: >
      I am a PhD student in the [Marx Lab](hannahmarx.com) at the University of
      New Mexico, interested in the ecology and evolution of flowering plants in
      island and alpine systems. Prior to beginning my PhD work in 2021, I
      earned my M.Ed. and teaching credentials at UMass-Boston through the
      Boston Teacher Residency in 2019 and taught 6th grade earth and space
      science in Olympia, WA. Before beginning my teaching career, I earned my
      M.S. in plant sciences at Washington State University in the [Roalson
      Lab](https://labs.wsu.edu/roalson/) in 2018, where I used high-throughput
      sequencing and species tree analyses to better understand Hawaiian
      *Cyrtandra*. I completed B.A. at the University of Colorado in 2015 where
      I looked into aberrant plant diversity using phylogenetic tools in the
      [Tripp Lab](https://trippreport.com/).
